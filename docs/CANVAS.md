# Canvas Script
Canvas provides an API that lets you automatically pull student information
and upload grades (with comments, such as for the unit test report!).  This
repository will eventually include a comprehensive script that (1)
automatically pulls student information to identify and organize assignments,
(2) runs a unit test for all assignments and outputs an aggregate report, and
(3) uploads grades to Canvas with the unit test report attached.
